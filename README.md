# hackernews-scraping

In this project I praticed web scraping from the hacker news website. Web scraping can be benefical because it helps gather the data you want from websites. This project used beautiful soup which is used to gather data. The data we gather in this project are the articles with more than 99 votes. The reason for this is so we don't have to scroll through the site to find the top articles.

How to install the project:

1. You can download this project to your code editor of choice.
2. Open up your terminal
3. Type python3 scrape.py in the terminal then articles with more than 99 votes will show in the terminal with the link, title and votes
